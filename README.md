# Boolean-Model-of-Cell-Wall-and-Osmotic-Stress-in-Apergillus-fumigatus
A single Boolean model of carbon metabolism signalling in A. fumigatus in response to cell wall and osmotic stress (cell_wall_and_osmotic_stress_in_combined.txt) created. 
To test if this model is accurate simulated cell wall (cell_wall_stress_in_combined_model.txt) and osmotic (osmotic_stress_in_combined_model.txt) stress separately in the combined model using jankeja's standalone osmotic (osmotic_stress.txt) and cell wall (cell_wall_stress.txt) simulation graphical output as a reference. 
The combined model pertubated to mimic possible new drug targets, SskB and RlmA (Combined_model_SskB_and_RlmA_perturbation). 
All .txt files are run using simulate function from the BoolSi python package.
